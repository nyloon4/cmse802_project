# Predicting Online Shopper Conversions

## project description  
this project explores whether we can predict if someone will make a purchase based on how they behave during an online shopping session. using machine learning models like logistic regression, xgboost, and weighted xgboost, i trained and evaluated classifiers that try to answer the simple question: will this person buy or not?

## objectives  
- use session-level data to predict **purchase intent**  
- test multiple classification models and compare performance  
- handle class imbalance using **weighted modeling**  
- evaluate model results with **recall, f1 score, and AUC**  
- visualize confusion matrices, bar chart comparisons, and ROC curves
